# ActiveJob::Cron

This gem provides recurrent functionality for your `ActiveJob`. The usage and implementation is highly inspired by [Sidetiq](https://github.com/tobiassvn/sidetiq).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'active_job-cron'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install active_job-cron

## Usage

It's very simple to use, just include `ActiveJob::Cron`, and sets your job's recurrent frequency:

```ruby
class MyJob < ActiveJob::Base
  include ActiveJob::Cron
  
  recurrence { daily }
  
  def perform
    # do something.....
  end
end
```

Or you can specify more complex recurrence like:

```ruby
class MyJob < ActiveJob::Base
  include ActiveJob::Cron
  
  recurrence { weekly.day(:thursday) }
  
  def perform
    # do something.....
  end
end
```

It uses [IceCube](http://seejohncode.com/ice_cube/) as recurrence's DSL, you can see more usages in its documentation.

## Known Issues

### Duplicate Jobs

If you have multiple servers, than you will face this issue. It means that it will have as many jobs triggered as the number of application you are running. It's because that every server has it's own clock to trigger a job, and for now there is no way to sync between different servers.

If anyone have a good idea to solve this, please open an issue 🙏.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
